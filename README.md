# TheAdicoder - KivyMD Application

**TheAdicoder** is a simple Python application built with KivyMD, a Material Design framework for Kivy. This app showcases a basic usage of KivyMD components, such as labels, and provides a welcoming message.

## Features

- **Material Design**: The app uses KivyMD to implement Material Design components.
- **Text Display**: The app displays a centered message saying, "Hey DevOps Welcome to theadicoder".
- **Cross-Platform**: The app can run on various platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theadicoder/theadicoder-KivyMD.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install kivymd
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Code Explanation

Here is a breakdown of the code:

```python
from kivymd.app import MDApp
from kivymd.uix.label import MDLabel

class MainApp(MDApp):
    def build(self):
        # This returns a centered label with the message
        return MDLabel(text="Hey DevOps Welcome to theadicoder", halign="center")

# Running the app when the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    MainApp().run()
```

- **MDLabel**: Displays a label with the text "Hey DevOps Welcome to theadicoder", aligned in the center.
- **MDApp**: This is the main class from KivyMD to build the application.
- **if __name__ == "__main__"**: Ensures the app only runs when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
